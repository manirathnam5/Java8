This project provides a comprehensive overview and examples of key features introduced in Java 8, a major release that brought several new functionalities to the Java language and its APIs. These features have improved the languageâ€™s efficiency, conciseness, and maintainability, while also introducing new ways of handling common programming tasks.

**Features Covered**

**1.Lambda Expressions**

Introduced to simplify the implementation of functional interfaces, lambda expressions allow you to write concise and readable code by reducing boilerplate syntax.

**2.Functional Interfaces**

Java 8 introduced a special kind of interface known as a functional interface, which contains exactly one abstract method. Key examples include Runnable, Callable, Comparator, and custom functional interfaces.

**3.Stream API**

The Stream API provides a functional approach to processing sequences of elements from collections, making it easy to perform bulk operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.

**4.Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**

Interfaces can now have default and static methods, allowing developers to add methods to existing interfaces without breaking the implementing classes.

**5.Optional Class**

The Optional class is used to represent a value that may or may not be present, reducing the risk of NullPointerException and promoting better error handling practices.

**6.Method References**
Method references provide a cleaner and more readable way to refer to methods without invoking them, often used in conjunction with lambda expressions.

**7.Date and Time API (java.time package)**

Java 8 introduced a new, modern Date and Time API that simplifies the manipulation of dates and times, offering better consistency and thread safety compared to the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar classes.

**8.Nashorn JavaScript Engine**

Nashorn is a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript engine integrated with the JVM, allowing Java applications to execute JavaScript code.

**9.Collectors and Parallel Streams**

The Collectors class provides useful methods for accumulating the elements of a stream into collections, and parallel streams allow multi-threaded processing for better performance in data-intensive applications.
